# Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Brilly Lutfan Qasthari!

I am a Fresh Graduate majoring in Informatics, AKPRIND Institute of Science & Technology Yogyakarta. Currently looking for career opportunities in Machine Learning and Data Science. During college I often attended Machine Learning training organized by IBM, Digital Talent Kominfo, and Dicoding. during the training I always worked on projects given by the training completely and on time. I was able to do this by staying focused on my studies so that I could graduate on time (4 years and 3 months) with a GPA of 3.64. I also had an internship experience at the Wonogiri Kominfo Office as a Web Developer where I was responsible for developing Web applications based on the work schedule of the Wonogiri Kominfo Office. I am looking for opportunities to contribute further in the Big Data industry to gain knowledge and interests that I have. Connect on LinkedIn or contact me at brilly.lutfan@gmail.com.
